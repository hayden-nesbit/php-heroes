This project utilizes PHP and MySQL. I'm using the CRUD methods of database projects (Create, Read, Update, Delete). For each of these I chose the following features, respectively:
1. Create a new user profile using a form on the home page.
2. Display all the users information from MySQL using the sql file provided.
3. Update an enemy to be a friend, and unfriend a friend to be an enemy.
4. Delete a power from a users profile (and from the sql database).
